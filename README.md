### My candidate POC project page for Bellingcat Tech Fellowship program.

It creates a 4-pane parallel view on a location from all 4 carginal directions.
If the underlying map engine provides 45 degree view on the particular location, one can quickly check its surrounding, a great tool for open-source inverstigative journalism.
A pan or zoom action on any pane is synced on all other views.
